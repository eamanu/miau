I've been told many times during the last few days that there are very special expectations of my speech here today.

Supposedly, or so I have heard, some expect my speech to pave the way for a fundamental reform of the European architecture, which will satisfy all kinds of alleged or actual British wishes. I'm afraid they are in for a disappointment. I've also heard that others are expecting the exact opposite, and are hoping that I will deliver the clear and simple message here in London that the rest of Europe is not prepared to pay almost any price to keep Britain in the European Union. I'm afraid these hopes will be dashed too.
